<h1 align="center">💰 Currency Denomination Detection using YOLO</h1>
<br>
<h2>Step 1:- Gathering Data</h2>
<ul> 
    <li>Gather images of the objects you want your model to detect
    <li>In this Case we Used Indian Currencies of diffrent denominations (ie. 10,20,50,100,200,500,2000)
    <li>For a smaller dataset, take about 30-40 images per object(If you are training on apples and oranges, for examples, find 30-40 different images of apples, and 30-40 for oranges)
    <li>Look for images that have different angles, colors, etc. Regarding the apples and oranges, try to find a variety of shapes and colors.
 </ul>

<h2>Step 2:- Annotating</h2>
<ul> 
    <li>Annotating is the process of drawing a box around the object in a photo, and giving it a name.  
    <li>This process tells the AI model that “This object is in this location, looks like this, and is called this” 
    <li> We will be using a free website called Roboflow to annotate, but there are others like it.
 </ul>

<h3>How to Annotate </h3>
<p>1. Open https://roboflow.com/ and create an account </p>
<p>2. Create a workspace, Select public plan and continue.</p>
